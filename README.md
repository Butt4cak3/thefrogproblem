# The Frog Problem

This is based on a [video by Matt Parker](https://youtu.be/ZLTyX4zL2Fc). If you
want to know what this is all about, then I recommend you check it out
first and then come back.

This repository contains the code for a website that can approximate solutions to the problem by simulation it. You can view the website at https://butt4cak3.github.io/thefrogproblem.
